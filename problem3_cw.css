/*Start with the included HTML file problem3_cw.html.
The starter HTML has an HTML table in it which we will talk more about later.
See if you can create a CSS file called problem3_cw.css that will style the page to produce a tic-tac-toe web page like the one represented in problem3.png*/

/*The title and the tic-tac-toe board should stay vertically and horzontally centered on the wb page.*/
/*Add additional styles to better format the title to use borders and a colored background*/
